AskSmart.org will be a single-purpose website for hosting a guide to
asking smart technical questions so the asker is more likely to get
back useful answers.

This guide is written as an antidote to ESR's
["How to Ask Questions The Smart Way"](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
[(alternate)](http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Essays/smart-questions.html)
which celebrates hostility and rudeness.  It claims
that RTFM is "an ancient and hallowed tradition".  It claims that
abusing those who don't ask questions correctly is "healthy and
appropriate."  These are the attitudes of bullies, and AskSmart
specifically refutes those ideas and others in ESR's piece.

# Guidelines for writing AskSmart

* Phrase directions in positive, not negative ways.  Instead of
"Don't do X", say "Instead of X, do Y" or better yet, just "Do Y."

* Do not mock the reader.

* Assume the best of intentions of the reader.

* Not knowing the answer, or not going through proper steps before
asking a question, is not a moral failing.

* No sarcasm.

* No belittling.
